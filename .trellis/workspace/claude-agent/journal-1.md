## Session 3: Migrate homepage and core lessons to Eleventy

**Date**: 2026-04-02
**Task**: Migrate homepage and core lessons to Eleventy

### Summary

Migrated the homepage and lessons 01-06 into the shared Eleventy layout/data flow, updated passthrough rules to protect migrated outputs, verified build output, and archived the completed subtask.

### Main Changes

- Migrated `index.html` and `lesson-01.html` through `lesson-06.html` into Eleventy source under `site/`.
- Reused shared sidebar, search, TOC, latest-updates, course-catalog, and progress data instead of duplicated page-local arrays/scripts.
- Updated `.eleventy.js` passthrough rules so migrated pages are generated from Eleventy while legacy non-migrated pages and shared assets still copy from `public/`.
- Rebuilt `docs/` output and verified key behaviors with Playwright against a local `docs/` preview server.
- Archived the completed Trellis subtask for homepage/core lesson migration.

## Session 4: Migrate resource pages into Eleventy

**Date**: 2026-04-02
**Task**: Migrate resource pages into Eleventy

### Summary

Migrated remaining resource and standalone pages into the Eleventy pipeline and verified the new pages with Playwright.

### Main Changes

- Migrated `lesson-07.html`, `rtk-install-guide.html`, `student-guide.html`, and `codex-first-lesson.html` from passthrough `public/` pages into Eleventy `site/` sources.
- Removed old passthrough handling in `.eleventy.js` for those pages and updated centralized content metadata plus shared search label logic for non-lesson entries.
- Rebuilt `docs/` output, smoke-tested the migrated pages with Playwright, and archived the completed `04-02-migrate-resource-pages` Trellis task.

## Session 5: Finalize Eleventy deploy cleanup

**Date**: 2026-04-02
**Task**: Finalize Eleventy deploy cleanup

### Summary

Aligned local preview, generated output, and Trellis docs with the Eleventy deploy workflow.

### Main Changes

- Finalized the Eleventy deploy workflow so `npm start` now builds the site and previews the generated `docs/` output instead of relying on the old `public/` preview model.
- Updated Trellis command docs and backend specs to reflect `site/` as migrated-page source, `docs/` as generated deploy output, and removed stale manual `public/` -> `docs/` mirror guidance.
- Rebuilt generated `docs/` output, added a root `favicon.ico` passthrough, and verified preview responses for homepage, lesson page, favicon, 404, and path traversal cases.

## Session 6: Close out static site refactor

**Date**: 2026-04-02
**Task**: Close out static site refactor

### Summary

Archived the parent static-site refactor task, removed legacy public page sources, and aligned frontend specs with the Eleventy workflow.

### Main Changes

- Archived the parent brainstorm task for the static site architecture refactor after the Eleventy migration subtasks were completed.
- Removed the legacy hand-authored `public/*.html` page sources now replaced by `site/` Eleventy sources and `docs/` build output.
- Updated frontend Trellis specs to reflect the current workflow: `site/` is the source of deployable pages, `public/` is primarily shared assets, and shared search/progress behavior now comes from Eleventy partials/data.
- Verification: `npm run build` succeeds and regenerates deployable output into `docs/`.
