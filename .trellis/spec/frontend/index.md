# Frontend Development Guidelines

> Best practices for frontend development in this project.

---

## Overview

The frontend in this repository is a static site built from plain HTML, CSS, and small inline JavaScript.

During the Eleventy migration:

- `public/` remains the legacy hand-authored page source and shared asset source
- `site/` is the source of truth for Eleventy-migrated pages, layouts, includes, and shared data
- `docs/` is the generated deployment output for GitHub Pages

The guides in this folder describe the conventions that already exist in this repo (no React/Vue, no TypeScript build, no component framework).

## How to Use These Guidelines

- When editing pages, start from the true source for that page (`public/` for legacy pages, `site/` for Eleventy-migrated pages).
- If you add or migrate a page meant to be deployed, verify the generated `docs/` output rather than treating `docs/` as a hand-edited source directory.
- If you introduce a new recurring pattern (CSS class, inline script behavior, shared include, or data shape), update the relevant guide so future changes stay consistent.
